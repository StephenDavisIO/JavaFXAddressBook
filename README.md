# JavaFX Address Book

## About This Project
This was completed for Assignment 2 during my COMP-2130 - Application Development Using Java at George Brown College. This application uses JavaFX to create a simple contact manager. This application was completed prior to my Data Structures & Algorithms course, so there are no algorithms within the code.
